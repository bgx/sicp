At first I wrote:

(define (an-integer-between low high)
  (let ((choice (amb low (an-integer-starting-from (+ low 1)))))
    (require (<= choice high))
    choice))

But looking at the "an-element-of" definition on page 414, there's another way.  I'm not (yet) sure of what the cost of all the "let"s would be, but this gets rid of them:

(define (an-integer-between low high)
  (require (<= low high))
  (amb low (an-integer-between (+ low 1) high)))
