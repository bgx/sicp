(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
    ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))

>>if b is greater than 0, the operator will evaluate to +, so (a-plus-abs-b a b) will evaluate to (+ a b)

if b is less than or equal to 0, the operator will evaluate to -, so (a-plus-abs-b a b) will evaluate to (- a b)

this is equivalent to a + |b|
