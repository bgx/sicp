(define (show x)
   (display-line x)
   x)

What does the interpreter print in response to evaluating each expression in the following sequence?

>>
Correct answers.

(define x (stream-map show (stream-enumerate-interval 0 10)))
0
; Value: x

(stream-ref x 5)
1
2
3
4
5
; Value: 5

(stream-ref x 7)
6
7
; Value: 7

Documenting my first attempt to show how wrong I was.  Mistakes:
- Didn't distinguish between printed values and return values
- Thought the second stream-ref call was "reading" the stream from the point it stopped reading during the first stream-ref call

(define x (stream-map show (stream-enumerate-interval 0 10)))
0

(stream-ref x 5)
1
2
3
4
5
5

(stream-ref x 7)
6
7
8
9
