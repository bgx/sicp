There is a serious flaw with building a squarer in this fashion:

(define (squarer a b)
  (multiplier a a b))
  
Explain.

If there is no value on the 'b connector', then setting a value on the 'a connector' would in fact result in a value on the 'b connector' that is the value of the 'a connector' squared.

However, say there is no value on the 'a connector' and a value is set on the 'b connector'.  The desired result is for a value of the square of the value of the 'b connector' to be set on the 'a connector'.  But in looking at the (process-new-value) definition inside (multiplier), we can see that for the condition of product (the 'b connector') having a value and neither m1 nor m2 having a value (both being the 'a connector' in this scenario), nothing happens.  It is not possible to place a value on the 'a connector' by setting a value on the 'b connector'.  The actual result does not equal the desired result.
