Labelling the atomic steps of each process:

P1
x = x * x
Access x, Access x, <Compute result>, Set x
a_A a_B s_C
A B C

P2
x = x * x * x
Access x, Access x, Access x, <Compute result>, Set x
a_D a_E a_F s_G
D E F G

>>

*Possible without serialization*
10^6
A, B, and C execute; then D, E, F, and G execute.

10^5
A, B, and D execute; then C executes; then E, F, and G execute.

10^4
A, B, D, and E execute; then C executes; then F and G execute.

10^3
A, B, D, E, and F execute; then C executes; then G executes.

10^6
D, E, F, and G execute; then A, B, and C execute.

10^4
D, E, F, and A execute; then G executes; then B and C execute.

10^2
D, E, F, A, and B execute; then G executes; then C executes.

>>

*Possible with serialization*
The steps of P1 and P2 can no longer interleave.  Thus:

10^6

(1)
P1 sets x to 10^2; P2 sets x to 10^6.
A, B, and C execute; then D, E, F, and G execute.

OR

(2)
P2 sets x to 10^3; P1 sets x to 10^6.
D, E, F, and G execute; then A, B, and C execute.
