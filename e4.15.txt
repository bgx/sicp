  (if (halts? try try)
      (run-forever)
      'halted)

If (halts? try try) returns true -- saying that (try try) halts -- then (try try) runs forever, and (halts? try try) is incorrect.

If (halts? try try) returns false -- saying that (try try) does not halt -- then (try try) halts, and (halts? try try) is incorrect.
