Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum of the squares of the two larger numbers.

>>
(define (square x)
    (* x x))

(define (sum-of-squares x y)
    (+ (square x) (square y)))

(define (sos-max2 a b c)
    (if (> a b)
        (if (> b c)
            (sum-of-squares a b)
            (sum-of-squares a c))
        (if (> a c)
            (sum-of-squares b a)
            (sum-of-squares b c))))

>> Could easily write tests for this.  I just tested with various values of input.  Looks right.
