*Possible*
101:  P1 sets x to 100 and then P2 increments x to 101.
121:  P2 increments x to 11 and then P1 sets x to x times x.
-- These can both happen, as they can if both P1 and P2 are entirely wrapped by a serializer.

100:  P1 accesses x (twice), then P2 sets x to 11, then P1 sets x.
-- This can happen now because the assignment to x in P1 is not serialized.

11:  P2 accesses x, then P1 sets x to 100, then P2 sets x.
-- Say the serialized part of P1 executes first.  Then P2 begins executing.  Since the assignment to x in P1 is not serialized, it can happen at any time before, during, or after the execution of P2.  So P2 accesses x, then P1 sets x to 100, then P2 sets x.


*Not possible*
110:  P2 changes x from 10 to 11 between the two times that P1 accesses the value of x during the evaluation of (* x x).
-- P2 and the evaluation of (* x x) by P1 are both serialized, so the execution of these can not interleaved.
