;; these will be the same:

(define (the-empty-termlist) '())
(define (rest-terms term-list) (cdr term-list))
(define (empty-termlist? term-list) (null? term-list))
(define (make-term order coeff) (list order coeff))
(define (order term) (car term))
(define (coeff term) (cadr term))

;; these are modified:

(define (adjoin-term term term-list)
  (let ((term-coeff (coeff term)))
    (cond ((=zero? term-coeff) term-list)
          ((equ? (order term) (length term-list)) (cons term-coeff term-list))
          (else (adjoin-term term (cons 0 term-list))))))
      
(define (first-term term-list) (make-term (- (length term-list) 1) (car term-list)))
