Normal order

iteration   ,   a, b
(gcd 206 40), 206, 40
(gcd 40 6)  ,  40, [1 remainder call]
[+1 remainder call evaluated]
(gcd 6 4)   , [1 remainder call], [2 remainder calls]
[+2 remainder calls evaluated]
(gcd 4 2)   , [2 remainder calls], [4 remainder calls]
[+4 remainder calls evaluated]
(gcd 2 0)   , [4 remainder calls], [7 remainder calls]
[+7 remainder calls evaluated]
[+4 remainder calls evaluated] <- to evaluate a because b is 0

Total remainder calls: 1+2+4+7+4=18




Applicative order

Remainder is evaluated once for each iteration of (gcd a b) where b is not 0
Thus,

Total remainder calls: 1+1+1+1=4
